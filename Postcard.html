  <p id="objective">Hello! My name is Jesus Negrete, I am from Dallas, Tx, pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. 
   My goal is to one day apply the critical thinking skills and ideas I have developed during my engineer major to the real world. 
   I am fascinated how far technology has come and I can see myself being a part of what the future of technology holds. Even if it seems 
   like everything has already been invented, there is still room for improvements all around us.  I can contribute to what has 
   already been created by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of current designs and concepts. Much like how the phrase 
   “the sky is the limit” has changed to “the sky is not the limit” over time.
   <p id="objective">I would define myself as a responsible and respectful person, who is always open to learn and try new things. 
   I am a good friend that enjoys collaborating with others.
